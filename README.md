# nyt_pips_solver

## Overview

This is my attempt at writing a Go based solver for the NYT Pips game released on 2025-08-18, and is strictly for fun! Comments, unit tests, design plans, etc., if supplied, are not going to adhere to professional standards.

## On AI Usage
This is **NOT** an exercise in "Vibe Coding", "Promp Engineering", or even speeding up development time with AI auto-complete (i.e. Copilot). This tooling is exciting and useful, but I wanted to approach this like a classic closed notes coding challenge. Perhaps down the road I might use my resources to explore potential optimizations, create a GUI to input/create game boards, or create fancy terminal visualizations with print statements - tasks I have far less interest in - but for now I am shooting for an unaided MVP that can reliably solve these puzzles. I saw none on Github at the time I started this project.

## How to use
Idk. I haven't figured out a file-based, clearly documented method for inputting a game board yet. Whatever it is, it will be much more difficult and time inefficient to set up than to just do the puzzle yourself. For now, you can check out the source code, update spec constants as needed, and try it out.
