# nyt_pips_solver

This is my attempt at writing a Go based solver for the NYT Pips game released on 2025-08-18, and is strictly for fun! Comments, unit tests, design plans, etc. are not going to adhere to professional standards.

## AI Usage
This is **NOT** an exercise in "Vibe Coding", "Promp Engineering", or even speeding up development time with AI auto-complete (i.e. Copilot). This tooling is exciting and useful, but I wanted to approach this like a classic closed-room, minimal notes coding challenge, and put my brain to the test.
